# **AI Project Repository**

This repository hosts multiple projects and their corresponding directories, each focusing on distinct algorithms, concepts, or games. Below is a breakdown of the structure and purpose of each project.

---

## **Repository Structure**
### **1. `.idea`**
- **Purpose**: Configuration files and settings for the IntelliJ IDEA development environment.
- **Details**: These files are auto-generated by IntelliJ IDEA to store project-specific settings, such as libraries, run configurations, and module settings.

---

### **2. Bayesian**
- **Purpose**: Implements concepts and algorithms related to Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling.
- **Potential Features**:
  - Bayesian network creation.
  - Conditional probability calculations.
  - Applications in classification or decision-making tasks.

---

### **3. CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problems)**
- **Purpose**: A collection of algorithms for solving CSPs, such as Sudoku, map coloring, or scheduling problems.
- **Implemented Algorithms**:
  - Backtracking search.
  - Forward checking.
  - Arc-consistency (AC-3).
- **Applications**: Solving logical puzzles or real-world problems that involve assigning values to variables under constraints.

---

### **4. Cherkerr**
- **Purpose**: Likely related to a game, algorithm, or system named "Cherkerr." Needs more context for a detailed description.
- **Potential Features**:
  - Minimax tree logic
  - Alpha-Beta prunning and catching

---

### **5. Hua Rang Dao**
- **Purpose**: Implements a solver or simulation for the Hua Rang Dao (Hua Rong Dao) puzzle, a sliding block puzzle inspired by Chinese history.
- **Key Features**:
  - State representation using a grid system.
  - A* search and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms for solving the puzzle.
  - Functionality to check target positions and simulate gameplay.

## **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-repository.git
   cd project-repository
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired project directory (e.g., `Bayesian` or `Hua Rang Dao`).
3. Run the scripts using Python or the specified environment for that project.

---

## **Requirements**
- **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- **Dependencies**: Install required libraries for individual projects using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  (Add `requirements.txt` files to project directories if applicable.)

---

## **Future Development**
- Add detailed documentation for each project, including usage examples.
- Implement test cases for verifying the correctness of algorithms.
- Enhance features or add new projects related to Bayesian inference, CSPs, or other algorithms.
